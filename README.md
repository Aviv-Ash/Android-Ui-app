this repository contains an app that was written in Kotlin and describes my favorite movie and lets you "purchase" tickets to one of a few screenings. (video below)
the app has 2 languages, build as a single activity, and is destined to have:
• At least 3 different types of widgets.
• At least one dialog.
• At least one animation chain containing at least 2 different animations (or
multiple different concurrent animations)
• Resource localization.
• Responsive UI at all times
• Text about the movie - An Introduction or a summary of the movie.
• Images from or about the movie.
• Display to the user at least 3 of the following options:
• Option for selecting the number of tickets.
• Total price of the amount of the selected ticket.
• Option for selecting a viewing date.
• Option for selecting between an adult and a child.
• Option for selecting a theatre
• A “Get Tickets” button for getting tickets. When clicked, display the relevant
information according to the options you implemented.
• Display a button to confirm their purchase.
When this Button is clicked, display to the user his latest purchase details
